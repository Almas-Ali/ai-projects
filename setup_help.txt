You don't have a required library installed on your system, hence the final bit of the error:
libespeak.so.1 error: no such file or directory found.

You can try to install espeak:
sudo apt install espeak

Or the development version of the library:
sudo apt install libespeak-dev

If you're interested by the multilingual version instead:
sudo apt install libespeak-ng-libespeak-dev
